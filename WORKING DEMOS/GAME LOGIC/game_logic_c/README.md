# RULES
```
> The goal of the game is to get rid of all the cards in your hand.
> Each player starts with 7 cards and the pile starts with 1 card and the deck has the rest.
> On your turn you have to play 1 card which either matches the value oor color of the top card in the pile.
> Playing a card adds it to the top of the pile.
> Wild cards match every color and value.
> If you don't have a card to play you must draw until you get a valid card.
> You then have the option to play last the drawn card.
> If you play a card and end up with only one card left in your hand you must call uno.
    > You can call uno by typing "UNO" followed by the index of the card you want to play (ex: "UNO 3" to play card #3 and call uno).
> Certain cards have special actions after they're played.
    > '0-9' (number cards) have no special actions
    > 'C' (wild card) cards are wild cards which allow you to choose their color.
    > 'P' (draw four) cards are wild cards which not only allow you change their color but also forces the next player draw 4 cards and skip their turn.
    > 'S' (skip) cards skip the next player's turn.
    > 'R' (reverse) reverses the order of the game (if the game has only 2 players it acts as a skip).
    > '+' (darw 2) forces the next player to draw 2 cards and skips their turn.
> If you needed to call uno but you didn't:
    > If another player calls uno before it gets back to your turn you must draw the appropriate amount of cards (uno punishment).
    > If no other player calls uno and it gets back to your turn you no longer need to call it.
> If you need to draw and their are no cards left to draw from all the cards in the pile except for the top card gets added to the deck and the deck gets shuffled.
    > If there are no cards available to add to take from the pile the player no longer needs to draw.
