# GAME LOGIC DEMOS

**game_logic.c**\n
    Game Logic File (written in C). This is the original game logic we programmed before we decided to switch to python.

**game_logic.py**\n
    Game Logic File (written in Python). This is the new game logic script.\n
    To run it (on linux), use the command **$python3 game_logic.py**\n
